Multiwoven is using the [git-flow ](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)workflow for managing git branches. Git flow repository operations are done using a git extension called [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). Installation instructions for gitflow can be found [here](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation)


## Gitflow 101


#### 1. A develop branch is created from main

Without the git-flow extensions

```
git branch develop
git push -u origin develop
```

When using git flow extension 


```
$ git flow init

Initialized empty Git repository in ~/project/.git/
No branches exist yet. Base branches must be created now.
Branch name for production releases: [main]
Branch name for "next release" development: [develop]

How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
Feature branches? [feature/]
Release branches? [release/]
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/]
Support branches? [support/]
Version tag prefix? []

$ git branch
* develop
 main
```

#### 2. Feature branches are created from develop

##### Create a feature branch

Without the git-flow extensions

```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature_branch
```


When using git flow extension 

```
git flow feature start feature_branch
```

##### Merging feature branch to develop

Without the git-flow extensions

```
git checkout develop
git merge feature_branch
```


When using git flow extension 

```
git flow feature finish feature_branch
```

#### 3. A release branch is created from develop


##### Create a release branch 

Without the git-flow extensions

```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/0.1.0
```

When using git flow extension 

```
git flow release start 0.1.0
Switched to a new branch 'release/0.1.0'
```

##### Merging release branch to main

Without the git-flow extensions

```
git checkout main
git merge release/0.1.0
```


When using git flow extension


```
git flow release finish '0.1.0'
```

#### 4. If an issue in main is detected a hotfix branch is created from main


##### Create hotfix branch

Without the git-flow extensions

```
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix_branch
```


When using git flow extension

```
git flow hotfix start hotfix_branch
```

##### Merge hotfix branch to main and develop

Without the git-flow extensions

```
git checkout main
git merge hotfix_branch
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix_branch
git branch -D hotfix_branch
```
When using git flow extension

```
$ git flow hotfix finish hotfix_branch
```

## Release process 

#### 1. Pull the latest develop branch and master branch in your local machine.

```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout develop
git pull
git fetch --tag
```

#### 2. Create feature branch from develop with the relevant release version 

```
git flow release start '0.0.1-beta'
```

#### 3. Add any last minute changes to release branch 

#### 4. Merge release branch back to main and develop

```
git flow release finish '0.0.1-beta'
```
#### 5. Push master branch, develop branch and the tags

```
# Push develop
git checkout develop
