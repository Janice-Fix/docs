They can be defined through:

- **SQL Editor**: For customized queries
- **Visual Table Selector**: For intuitive interface
- **Existing dbt Models or Looker Looks**: Leveraging pre-built models

### Importance of a Unique Primary Key
Every model must have a unique primary key to ensure each data entry is distinct, crucial for data tracking and updating.

## Syncs: Customizing Data Flow

### Overview
'Syncs' in Multiwoven helps you move data from sources to destinations. They help you in mapping the data from your models to the destination.

There are two types of syncs:
- **Full Refresh Sync**: All data is synced from the source to the destination.
- **Incremental Sync**: Only the new or updated data is synced.

## FAQs

### What if I Alter My Model?
Changes in your model configuration impact the sync process, particularly for SaaS destinations. Only the mapped columns in your sync configurations are tracked for changes.

### What Happens When I Delete a Model?
If you delete a model, all syncs associated with it are also deleted. However, the source and destination configurations remain intact.

### Can I Sync Data from Multiple Sources to a Single Destination?
Yes, you can sync data from multiple sources to a single destination. You can create multiple syncs for each source and map them to the same destination.
