</Card>

The entire process of setting up a Reverse ETL pipeline is composed of three main steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Source">
    The first step is to set up the source of the data. This could be a data warehouse, a database, or any other source of data.
    Head over to the [source setup](/sources/overview) guide to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Destination">
    The second step is to set up the destination for the selected source. This could be a CRM, a marketing automation platform, or any other destination.
    Head over to the [destination setup](/destinations/overview) guide to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Modeling & Sync">
    The final step is to model the data and sync it from the source to the destination. This is where you define the data model and the sync schedule.
    Head over to the [data modeling](/models/overview) and [sync](/sync/overview) guides to get started.
