Multiwoven is an open-source Reverse ETL platform, enabling users to seamlessly integrate data from various sources like Snowflake, Redshift, and BigQuery, and load it into their business tools like Salesforce, Hubspot, and Zendesk. Multiwoven's architecture is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, allowing for easy extensibility and adaptability. The platform is built using cutting-edge technologies, ensuring reliability and efficiency in data operations.

## Architecture

Multiwoven's architecture is divided into four main components: the **backend**, **frontend**, **integrations**, and **data pipelines**.

### Backend: The Control Plane `multiwoven-server`

At the heart of Multiwoven's architecture is its backend service, known as `multiwoven-server`. This crucial component acts as the control plane, expertly handling user management, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), REST APIs, and intricate business logic. Developed using Ruby on Rails, `multiwoven-server` ensures a reliable, secure, and flexible foundation, essential for the effective functioning of the platform.

### Frontend: User Interface

Multiwoven's frontend is a ReactJS application that provides a user-friendly interface for users to manage their data pipelines. The frontend is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to seamlessly create, edit, and monitor their data pipelines.

### Integrations: The `multiwoven-integrations` Ruby GEM

Multiwoven's integrations are built using the `multiwoven-integrations` Ruby GEM. This GEM provides a simple, yet powerful way to integrate with various data sources and business tools. The GEM is designed to be highly extensible, allowing users to easily add new integrations.

### Data Pipelines and Worker Logic: Leveraging Temporal

Multiwoven's data pipelines and worker logic are built using Temporal. Temporal is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant orchestration engine that allows users to build resilient applications. Temporal is designed to be highly extensible, allowing users to easily add new workflows.
