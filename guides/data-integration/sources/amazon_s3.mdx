## Connect AI Squared to S3

This guide will help you configure the S3 Connector in AI Squared to access and use your S3 bucket files.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary access id, secret access key, region, bucket, path, and the file type you wish to read from.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Connect to S3

### Step 1: Navigate to AWS S3 Console

Start by logging into your AWS Management Console and navigating to the AWS S3 service.

1. Sign in to your AWS account at [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. In the AWS services search bar, type "S3" and select it from the dropdown.

### Step 2: Locate AWS S3 Configuration Details

Once you're in the AWS S3 console, you'll find the necessary configuration details:

1. **Access Key and Secret Access Key:**
   - Click on your username at the top right corner of the AWS Management Console.
   - Choose "Security Credentials" from the dropdown menu.
   - In the "Access keys" section, you can create or view your access keys.
   - If you haven't created an access key pair before, click on "Create access key" to generate a new one. Make sure to copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key as they are shown only once.

2. **Bucket:**
   - Once inside of the AWS S3 console you should be able to see the list of buckets available, if not go ahead and create a bucket by clicking on the "Create bucket" button.

3. **Region:**
   - In the same list showing the buckets, there's a region assotiated with it.

4. **Path:**
   - The path where the file you wish to read from. This field is optional and can be left blank.

5. **File type:**
   - The files within the path that was selected should help determine the file type.

### Step 3: Configure S3 Connector in Your Application

Now that you have gathered all the necessary details enter the following information:
   - **Region:** The AWS region where your S3 bucket resources are located.
   - **Access Key ID:** Your AWS IAM user's Access Key ID.
   - **Secret Access Key:** The corresponding Secret Access Key.
   - **Bucket:** The name of the bucket you want to use.
   - **Path:** The path directory where the files are located at.
   - **File type:** The type of file (csv, parquet).

### Step 4: Test the S3 Connection

After configuring the connector in your application:

1. Save the configuration settings.
2. Test the connection to S3 from your application to ensure everything is set up correctly.
3. Run a test query or check the connection status to verify successful connectivity.

Your S3 connector is now configured and ready to query data from your S3 data catalog.

## Building a Model Query

The S3 source connector is powered by [DuckDB S3 api support](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/httpfs/s3api.html). This allows us to use 
SQL queries to describe and/or fetch data from an S3 bucket, for example:
```
SELECT * FROM 's3://my-bucket/path/to/file/file.parquet';
```

From the example, we can notice some details that are required in order to perform the query:
   - **FROM command: `'s3://my-bucket/path/to/file/file.parquet'`** You need to provide a value in the same format as the example.
   - **Bucket: `my-bucket`** In that format you will need to provide the bucket name. The bucket name needs to be
   the same one provided when configuring the S3 source connector.
   - **Path: `/path/to/file`** In that format you will need to provide the path to the file. The path needs to be
   the same one provided when configuring the S3 source connector.
   - **File name and type: `file.parquet`** In that format you will need to provide the file name and type at the end of the path. The file type needs to be
   the same one provided when configuring the S3 source connector.
