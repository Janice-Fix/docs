<Warning>**WARNING** The following guide is intended for developers to set-up Multiwoven locally. If you are a user, please refer to the [Self-Hosted](/guides/setup/docker-compose) guide.</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

<Tip>**Note**: if you are using mac or windows, you will need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) instead of just docker. Docker Desktop includes both docker and docker-compose.</Tip>


Verify that you have the correct versions installed:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Multiwoven/multiwoven.git
```

2. Navigate to the `multiwoven` directory

```bash
cd multiwoven
```

3. Create a `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Build docker images
    
```bash
docker-compose build
```

5. Start the containers

```bash
docker-compose up
```

6. Stop the containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Usage

Once the containers are running, you can access the ```Multiwoven UI``` at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The ```multiwoven API``` is available at [http://localhost:3000/api/v1](http://localhost:3000/api/v1).

## Running Tests

1. Running the complete test suite on the multiwoven server

```bash
docker-compose exec multiwoven-server bundle exec rspec
```
