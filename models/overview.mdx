### Unique Primary Key Requirement

- **Essential Configuration**:
    Every model in Multiwoven must be configured with a unique primary key.
    This primary key is pivotal for uniquely identifying each record in your dataset.

- **Configuring the Primary Key**:
  - During the final step of model creation, select a column that holds unique values from your dataset.

  <Tip>Ensuring the uniqueness of this primary key is crucial for the integrity and accuracy of data synchronization.</Tip>

- **Importance of a Unique Key**:
  - A unique primary key is essential for effectively managing data synchronization.
  - It enables the system to track and sync only the new or updated data to the designated destinations, ensuring data consistency and reducing redundancy.
